        Welcome, this guide will walk you through how to use <strong>{{ config["SERVICE"] }}</strong> to retrieve music
        information from various streaming platforms as well as how to request your listening activity data by calling
        OAuth 2.0 protected endpoints.
    </p>

    <h2>Search for Music</h2>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Make sure your are familier working with CLI (Command Line Interface).
        </li>
        <li>
            We will be using <strong>cURL</strong> for making API requests, so make sure you have it installed on your
            system. But you can also use any HTTP client of your choice.
            You may download it from <a href="https://curl.se/download.html">here</a> and scroll down to find
            download for your operating system. Or you can use package manager came with your OS to install it.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We can use the <a href="{{ url_for('docs.references', reference='search') }}">Search</a> endpoint
        to find music information. You just need to provide the artist and song or album name.
        So, let's search for "<i>Shelter</i>" by "<i>Porter Robinson</i>". We will make a GET request to the
        <code>/api/search</code> endpoint like this:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET "{{ base_url }}/api/search/Porter%20Robinson:Shelter"</code></pre>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Notice we are not using query parameters to search for music, instead we are using a path parameter
        to pass the search query. And a colon (<code>:</code>) is used to separate the artist and song name in the URL.
        This is how the API is designed and the primary reason for this is to avoid issues with
        special characters in the query string. For example, if the song or artist name contains a slash
        (<code>/</code>), it is misunderstood as a path separator when using query parameters.
    </blockquote>
    <p>If everything goes well, the API will return the a JSON response with the metadata about requested music.</p>

    <blockquote>&#10024; Congratulations, you just used the search endpoint to retrieve music information!</blockquote>

        You can explore the <a href="{{ url_for('docs.references', reference='search') }}">Search Reference</a>
        for more details on how to use the search endpoint, including how to retrieve music information from a specific
        streaming platform by using the <code>platform</code> query parameter.

    <h2>Retrieve Listening Activity</h2>
    <p>
        To retrieve a user's listening activity, we need to use the
        <a href="{{ url_for('docs.references', reference='activity') }}">Activity</a> endpoint.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create an Account</strong>: If you haven't already, you need to create an account on the
            <strong>{{ config["SERVICE"] }}</strong>.
            Go to <a href="{{ url_for_security('register', next=request.url) }}">Sign Up</a> page and create an account.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Link a Service</strong>: After creating an account and/or logging in, Follow the <a
                href="{{ url_for('docs.concepts', concept='activity') }}">Activity</a> guide to link a service to
            your account.</li>
        <li>Now go to the <a href="{{ base_url }}/api/me"><code>/api/me</code></a> route in your browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        &#10024; Congratulations, if you are listening to music on a linked service, you will see metadata about your
        current listening activity
        in JSON format!
    </blockquote>
