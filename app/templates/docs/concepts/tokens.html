        Tokens are used to authenticate your app and access protected endpoints. This guide explains how to use access
        tokens and refresh tokens.
    </p>

    <h2>Access Tokens</h2>

    <p>
        An access token is a string that is used to authenticate your app and access protected endpoints. It is a
        short-lived token.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the access token, you must include the following HTTP header in your API calls:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>Authorization</code></td>
            <td><code>Bearer &lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Note that the access token is valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds). After that time, the token expires and you need to
        request a new one.
    </p>

    <h2>Refresh Tokens</h2>
    <p>
        A refresh token is a long-lived token that can be used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user
        to re-authorize your app. This is useful when the access token expires, allowing you to maintain access without
        user intervention.
        Refresh tokens are typically issued alongside access tokens during the authorization flow. When you exchange
        the authorization code for an access token, you will also receive a refresh token.
    </p>

    <p>
        To obtain a new access token using a refresh token, you must send a POST request to the token endpoint with the
        following parameters:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>grant_type</code></td>
            <td><code>refresh_token</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>refresh_token</code></td>
            <td>A valid refresh token that you previously obtained.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    And the following HTTP headers:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Header</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>Content-Type</code></td>
            <td><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>Authorization</code></td>
            <td><code>Basic &lt;base64 encoded CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</main>
