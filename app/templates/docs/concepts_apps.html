        <strong>Apps</strong> allow you to access protected endpoints like
        <a href="{{ url_for('docs.reference_activity')}}">Activity</a>. This guide explains how to create and manage
        apps.
    </p>

    <p>
        To create an app, go to your <a href="{{ url_for('oauth.dashboard') }}">Dashboard</a> and click on "Create
        App" button.
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/dashboard.png') }}" alt="Dashboard Screenshot" class="screenshot">
    </p>
    <p>
        Then fill in the details for your app:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Name:</strong> A unique name for your app.</li>
        <li><strong>App Description:</strong> A brief description of what your app does.</li>
        <li><strong>Website</strong> [OPTIONAL]: A URL to website where users can get more information about your
            application.</li>
        <li><strong>Redirect URIs:</strong> The URL where users will be redirected after authorizing your app.
            This is where you will receive the authorization code. You can add multiple redirect URIs if needed.
    </ul>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/dashboard-create-app-filled.png') }}" alt="Dashboard Screenshot"
        class="screenshot">
    </p>
    <p>
        After creating the app, you will receive a <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>.
        Keep
        these safe as they are used to authenticate your app.
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='docs/dashboard-app-info.png') }}" alt="Dashboard Screenshot"
            class="screenshot">

    </p>
    <p>
        Your app is now created and you can use the Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate your app with the yutify
        API.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to edit your app details, you can do so by clicking on the "Edit" button next to your app in the
        dashboard. And if you want to delete your app, you can click on the "Delete" button.
